# text to speech with emotion analysis
The program performs two main tasks: text-to-speech synthesis and emotion prediction from text.
For the text-to-speech synthesis, the program utilizes pre-trained models (Tacotron2 and WaveGlow) from the NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples repository. It loads these models and sets them up for inference on the GPU. The input text is provided, and the program generates mel-spectrograms using Tacotron2 and converts them into audio waveforms using WaveGlow. The resulting audio is saved as a WAV file and played back using the Audio class in the Jupyter Notebook.

For the emotion prediction from text, the program uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) library. It installs the library and imports the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class. The predict_emotion function is defined, which takes the input text, calculates sentiment scores using the VADER analyzer, and predicts the emotion as "positive," "negative," or "neutral" based on the scores.

The program demonstrates the integration of these functionalities, showcasing how to synthesize speech from text and predict the associated emotion using pre-trained models and libraries.

Please note that the program includes additional code segments related to installing dependencies and loading utility functions, which may be necessary for the specific environment or use case but not directly related to the core functionality of text-to-speech synthesis and emotion prediction.
